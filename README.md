## Project Overview

This project explored the relevance of management systems to the contemporary society where 
computers have made tasks easier, more efficient and organized. Rental management system 
is a planned system of the storage, processing and dissemination of data in the form needed to 
carry out various rental functions which simplify the tiresome manual way of recording and 
writing rental information on papers. There is need for an automated rental management system 
that can be uses to store tenant activities in a centralized database which would replace the 
manual system that is currently being used. The manual system has challenges that include 
inadequate communication, lack of real-time data insights, poor tenant and financial tracking
and use of a lot of paperwork.
The objective in regard to the project is to come up with an application that will be used to 
automate the manual management of rental operations of Kabuku Students Rentals Inc. hence 
the title "Automated Rental management system (RMS)”. Being a web-based application; there 
is an assumption of users being connected to the internet. The scope of the project cuts across 
an administrator and three types of clients; tenants, landlords and caretakers. It targets the 
environment of Kabuku Student Rentals Inc.
